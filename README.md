## About
A Python application that uses the ascii_magic pip package to convert images into ASCII art. Huge thanks to the people who made [ascii_magic](https://pypi.org/project/ascii-magic/). It is an awsome package and I sugest that you check it out.

## Installation
You can just download the source code with the green "Code" button or get a pre-built executable from the Releases and download the correct one for your OS. Please report any issues, bugs or future improvements. Thank youðŸ™‚.
